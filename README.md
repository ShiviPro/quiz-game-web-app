# quiz-game-web-app
A fully functional quiz game web app made with HTML, CSS, Vanilla JS, JQuery, and AngularJS.
The project has passed the final production phase. All the usual functions are implemented correctly, along with appropriate animations.

Also, note -

* An internet connection would be required to display certain sections of the website, since CDNs of libraries like jQuery, FontAwesome, Google Fonts and frameworks like AngularJS.

* Also, it is to be noted that if you are not using localhost to view the project, you might need to give the absolute path to the img tag's src attribute, in order to render images perfectly on your browsers.

# Also note that, if you want to view the website in the best way possible, please use mozilla firefox, since I have used certain CSS animations that might not work in the expected way in other browsers like chrome, opera, internet explorer, ms edge, and so on. Although, there is no noted difference in the functionality of the website. So if you want, you can go ahead with any of the browsers.

* On Github pages host i.e. https://shivipro.github.io/quiz-game-web-app/ , the images are not displayed due to github image constraints, but on local hosting, the project works perfectly fine with accurate image loading.

* Live Leaderboard functionality will come eventually, as a part of additional updates.
